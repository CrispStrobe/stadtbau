# Contributing to Hectopolis

Thank you for helping. Before you start, read `PLAN.md` (scope, model, roadmap) and
`CLAUDE.md` (conventions). The non-negotiables are:

1. **License.** Your contribution is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later **with** the
   additional permission in `LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md`. Sign off every commit
   (`git commit -s`) to certify the Developer Certificate of Origin below.
2. **No code or data of incompatible origin.** Allowed dependency licenses: MIT, BSD,
   Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, LGPL, GPL-3.0-or-later, Zlib, ISC, Unlicense, CC0. Allowed data
   licenses: CC0, CC-BY 4.0, Datenlizenz Deutschland 2.0, public law texts. Never copy from
   proprietary games, from Ökolopoly/ecopolicy materials, or from share-alike datasets.
3. **Every user-facing string** goes into both `app/lib/l10n/app_de.arb` and
   `app/lib/l10n/app_en.arb` in the same commit.
4. **Every model parameter** goes into `data/params/*.json` with a `source`, and the
   matching `docs/model/*.md` explains the formula and cites it.
5. Run `tools/check.sh` before opening a pull request.
